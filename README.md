## 3) Stale-Lead Reconciliation (including Golem lane cancellation/justification)

### Verified stale/closed evidence (2026-02-16 UTC)

- [golemcloud/golem#1926](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/issues/1926) — **Closed** (cross-references `#2774`, `#2773`)
- [golemcloud/golem-ai#23](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-ai/issues/23) — **Closed** (cross-reference `#90`)
- [algora.io/challenges/tsperf](https://algora.io/challenges/tsperf/) — listing appears stale vs published winning solution

### Task-lane reconciliation

- Task `2ROpCa7UdL0k9ivypYuK0` is treated as **canceled/frozen stale lane** with justification: primary bounty issue closed, no active claimable path evidenced.
- Re-open criteria: fresh timestamped evidence of active issue + payout path + acceptance criteria.

## 4) Classification Integrity

This report uses **pipeline classes only**:
- `ACTIONABLE_NOW`
- `CONDITIONAL`
- `NO_GO_STALE`
- `NO_GO_CLOSED`

No decision is based on “hackathon vs bounty” category alone.
